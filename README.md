# Darcula for JDK 6
Darcula Look and Feel for JDK 6+, fixed a compiler issue on Java 6.

Usage: download build/darcula_jdk6.jar, include in your own Java Swing project, then call:

UIManager.setLookAndFeel("com.bulenkov.darcula.DarculaLaf");

Then this will bring your the IntelliJ IDEA like dark theme.

Tested on Mac OS 10.10 with Java 6 installed.
